## Introduction:
This folder contains some sample implemtations of the ASP expert system work done so far. 

# Installation instructions:
To run the filles you will need to install the CLORM Python ASP interface and the Clingo ASP. So far the only way I know how to do this is to first install Anaconda and then both these can be installed easily. Follow the instrctions here: https://github.com/potassco/clorm once you have installed anaconda it should take only 2 commands to install Clingo and Clorm. Once you have done the instllation, you should be able to run the top level python file as per normal.
