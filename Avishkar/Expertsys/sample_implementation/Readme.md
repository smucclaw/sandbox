## Introduction:
This folder contains some sample implemtations of the ASP expert system work done so far. 

### Installation instructions:
To run the filles you will need to install the CLORM Python ASP interface and the Clingo ASP. So far the only way I know how to do this is to first install Anaconda and then both these can be installed easily. Follow the instrctions here: https://github.com/potassco/clorm once you have installed anaconda it should take only 2 commands to install Clingo and Clorm. Once you have done the instllation, you should be able to run the top level python file as per normal.

### Project description:
There are 2 toy examples taken up here. Once is a set of rules that describes when a person associatied with a company must pay corporation tax, and the other is a simpler temporal example encoding the 'inertia law' ie. if an atom is true at time T, then it is true at time T+1. This temporal example serves to illustrate an important feature of the system which we shall describe later. For each example the user only needs to interact with and run, the top level python file called 'corp_tax_python.py' and 'temporal_python.py' respectively. The user first specifies some parameters in the python file such as a 'root query' and some numerical parameters and then runs it. The user then gets asked a sieries of questions relevant to the query and responds by editing the python file. Once the truth value of the query is established the Q and A process end and if the query is true or if any rules have been overriden the relevant justification graph(s) will be produced (currently a list of directed edges) up to the depth specified in the parameters. If the query is not deemed to be true then the user gets a justification graph whose root node is the query itself and whose leaf nodes are user responses whose truth value has been 'flipped' to be the opposite of what the user inputed. Ie it tells the user how the query could have been made true by making as few changes to their initial responses as possible. Or put differently, it explains to the user why the query wasn't true based on their initial responses. More on this later.  

### Setting parameters in the python file:
