To do:
Figure out how merging/pull requests work 

Pull requests:
To merge some branch into main branch:
Open pull request
Merge Pull request
Confirm

This is all done via the github UI
Works only if there are no conflicts.
You can choose a different branch than the main branch as the target of the merge via the github gui, when you create the pull request. 

How to create new branch locally and push it to remote repo (this automatically uses main as the base branch):

git checkout -b new-branch
git push origin new-branch

To use a different branch as the base branch do: 

git checkout -b new-branch [<base-branch-name>]
