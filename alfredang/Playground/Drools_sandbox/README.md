# Some notes on Drools

### Project setup
- It seems like we need Maven? (get up & running: https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html)
- How do i get a template drools project with maven? I found https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.kie/kie-drools-archetype but I'm not sure how to use maven in the right way to get it
