## Takeaways from reading through DeonDigital's CSL Readme


### "Your first CSL Contract"

1. I like the way events are specified, they're simple and easy to use.
   The functional nature of CSL also saves a lot of energy writing 
   helper functions (pattern-matching ftw)

2. Contract specification seems relatively simple for the test-cases, 
   how does our DSL compare? Writing something equivalent might
   be helpful for comparison.
