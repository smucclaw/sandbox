DMN table

Cf. https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.15/reference/dmn/decision-table/hit-policy/

Annex A (interpreted strictly) is actually inconsistent with Annex B, specifically the case of a group of size 2 with 2 children from different households.

The rules actually follow a hit policy of "first". I.e. pick the first row that is consistent with the situation.

(This is identical to pattern matching in Haskell.)

---

It's possible to systematically translate such a "first" hit policy table into a flowchart.

The algorithm isn't immediately obvious though.

Seems to work: start from the first relevant variable in the first row. Then move on to the next relevant variable in the first same row. Do likewise for subsequent rows.

layout:
  name: dagre

max group size
  2: yes
  otherwise: eligibility
    all eligible: max group size
      5: children's household
        different household: max # of children
          hogsrd *: yes.
          //otherwise: no
        same household: max # of children
          4: yes.
          //otherwise: no
      //otherwise: no
    //otherwise: no
* hogsrd = half of group size, round down
otherwise
  no
```
