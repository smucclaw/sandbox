How do we model nested conditions?
Consider the problem:

  You may order any of the following flavours of ice cream:
     a. Chocolate
     b. Strawberry
     c. Vanilla
     d. Any flavour listed on any of the following pages of the menu:
        (i)   page 12
        (ii)  page 13
        (iii) page 16

And that's fine. What about conditional conditions?
     e. On weekdays, any flavour listed on page 14.
     f. On weekends, any flavour listed on page 15.

What if the nested conditions aren't just nested, but chained?

     You may buy any
                   - automobile
                   - light truck, or
                   - motorcycle
     that is coloured
                    - red
                    - green, or
                    - yellow
     that was manufactured between 2010 and 2016

We can model these "chained" conditions as
    AND [ vehicleType ANY [ automobile, light truck, motorcycle ] ]
        , colour      ANY [ red, green, yellow ]
        , manufDate    IN [ 2010 .. 2016 ]
        ]

Translated back to a more legalistic form with the "and"s and "or"s put back

   You may buy any vehicle that satisfies all the following conditions:
      1. the vehicle type is any of the following:
         a. automobile,
         b. light truck, or
         c. motorcycle;
      2. the colour is
         a. red,
         b. green, or
         c. yellow; and
      3. the manufacturing year is in the range 2010 to 2016.

The placement of the connectors between the second-last and last elements
of the list is just something we've all gotten used to, but when you think
about it, it's as arbitrary as the fact that the hour after 12am is 1pm.

If you were designing the time system from scratch, surely you would have
  am: 1 .. 12
  pm: 1 .. 12

But instead we have
  12am, 1am .. 11am
  12pm, 1pm .. 11pm

Weird offsets are everywhere.
