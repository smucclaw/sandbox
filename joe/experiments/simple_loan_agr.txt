Ideas for a more declarative abstract syntax for the simple loan agreement,
closer to the text in Table 1 of Flood and Goodenough.

Key ontological elements in regulative rules that we want to talk about:
- Party: an agent in the real world involved in a contract.
- Event: something that happens in the real world, brought about by the actions of parties.
- Obligation: the legal duty of some agents to do something, like bring about an event or fulfill another obligation.
  Obligations can be instantiated and upon instantiation, they come into effect.
  They are like automata with various states:
	- In effect
	- Fulfilled
	- Breached
	- Suspended
	- Terminated
  They can be attached to some parties so we know who to point our finger at if things go wrong.
  They can change their state based on events that happen in the real world, as well as the change in state of other obligations.
- Contract: TODO

Things to do:
- Handle timers in a more declarative fashion.
- Try out petri net tools like Tina and Romeo since they allow for global variables.
- How do we know which obligations are reparable? We need to know this to determine if the contract has been breached.

-- Initialization of contract and requesting principal amount goes here.

-- Primary obligations:
Obligation: Pay payment 1
Parties: Borrower
Instantiated upon: TODO
Upon instantiation, start timer for 1 year
Fulfilled upon: Payment 1 event occurs
Breached upon: Timeout.

Obligation: Pay payment 2
Parties: Borrower
Instantiated upon: TODO
Upon instantiation, start timer for 2 years
Fulfilled upon: Payment 1 event occurs
Breached upon: Timeout.

-- Contrary to duty obligations:
Permission: Notify Borrower
Parties: Lender
Instantiated upon:
	Either of the following:
	- Breach of Pay payment 1
	- Breach of Pay payment 2
	- Representations and warranties
	- Covenants
	- Bankruptcy
Upon instantiation, start timer for 2 days.
Fulfilled upon:
	Either of the following:
	- Lender notifies borrower event.
	- Timeout.

Obligation: Cure default
Parties: Borrower
Instantiated upon: Lender notifies borrower event.
Upon instantiation, start a timer for 3 days.
Fulfilled upon: Borrower cures event of default.
Breached upon: Timeout.

Obligation: Accelerated repayment
Parties: Borrower
Instantiated upon: Borrower pays outstanding amount to Lender.
Upon instantiation, terminate all other active obligations and start a timer for 1 day.
Fulfilled upon: Borrower pays Lender outstanding event.
Breached upon: Timeout.
Special rule: Unreparable.
