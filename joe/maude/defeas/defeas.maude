---(
  A preference relation is the transitive closure of a one-step reduction
  relation given by a small-step operational semantics.
  In other words, we view the state space of the defined transition system as
  a thin category representing a poset.

  In simpler terms, this means we define a transition system with rules
  of the form 'r1 => 'r2, and we then take 'r3 < 'r4 to mean 'r4 is reachable
  from 'r3 in one or more steps.
