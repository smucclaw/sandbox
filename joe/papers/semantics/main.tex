\begin{definition} [Event]
  $E@t$ denotes a real world event $E$ occurring at time $t$.
\end{definition}

We use $\traces$ to denote the set of all traces and $\fintraces$ to denote the
set of finite traces.

\begin{definition} [Obligation template]
  An obligation template is a tuple
  \begin{align*}
    O \defeq
    \langle
      P, \, S, \, n_i, \, \instwff, \,
      \suswff, \, \termwff, \, \reswff, \, \contwff, \, \brewff, \, \fulwff
    \rangle
  \end{align*}
  where $P$ is a finite, non-empty set of parties involved in the contract,
  and the $\varphi_i$ formulae in some first-order extension of LTL.

  Such a template can be dynamically instantiated at runtime to form an
  automaton $\obaut$ with states given by
  $S = \set{\ineffstate, \, \susstate, \, \expstate, \, \brestate, \, \fulstate}$.

  $n_i$ is the number of obligation instances to instantiate
\end{definition}
